/**
 * There are ten Tactics cards. Tactics cards are played instead of Troop cards
 * to influence the formations. A player may hold as many Tactics cards as he
 * wishes within his hand size of seven, but may never play more than one more
 * than his opponent has played. That means, a player can always play a Tactics
 * card unless he has already played more than his opponent. Each Tactics card
 * has a special function and belongs to one of the following three categories.
